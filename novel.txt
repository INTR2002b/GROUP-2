He didn't know why they were there... but they were. 
Surrounding them, was a magical forest full of fairies and unicorns. “Hey humans!” -said the unicorn, “Welcome to the magical land of Interface Development where your dreams come true, my name is Rocco and I’ll guide you through this amazing journey”.
He continued, “These are my pals, RobRebel, Ramon, Nastaran, Xavier, Adam, and Eyel. In  this land you can create anything imaginable, especially with Bill Murray.” After he explained all the rules of the land, they held hooves, looked into each others eyes, and went on their merrily way. He realized that he didn’t introduce himself, “my name is Information Architecture, I’m so glad I’m in the land of Interface Development”. 
In the magical forrest there was a dog with a mouse in it it’s mouth.
